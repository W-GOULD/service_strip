# service_strip
Service strip is a tool which can be passed a nmap output and split hosts up depending on what service is open. Its not great if you are only focusing on a small amount of hosts but if you have a large amount of hosts you are targeting it can be quite useful.

## Requirements
For the script to work you will need to download and install gnmap, which can be found here https://gist.github.com/nopslider/5984316
